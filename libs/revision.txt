    [Merge-107] [Stats] Avoid DCHECK crashing if SSRCs are not unique.
    
    To properly handle SSRC collisions in non-BUNDLE we need to change how
    RTP stats IDs are generated, but that is a riskier change to be dealt
    with in a separate CL.
    
    For now, we just make sure that crashing is not a possibility during
    SSRC collisions as a mitigation for https://crbug.com/1361612. This is
    achieved by adding a TryAddStats() method to RTCStatsReport returning
    whether successful.
